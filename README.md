# Advanced Vertretungsplan

This is a little web app I made for fellow students of my school to view the substitution plan in a nice and functional UI.

Every day, the substitution plan gets uploaded to an itslearning course in PDF format. This is often annoying and slow to open though, so I had the idea to write a script that automatically logs in, downloads the plan and provides it to the students.
And why not combine that with an awesome interface?

So, this is Advanced Vertretungsplan!
